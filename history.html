      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>Since its founding in 2007, Maki High School has grown from a small community institution 
         into one of the most respected schools in the Kilimanjaro region.</p>

         <section>
  <h2>Founding and Motto</h2>
  <p>Maki High School was established in 2007 in Rombo District, Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. 
     The name “Maki” comes from the two villages <strong>Marangu</strong> and <strong>Kitowo</strong>. 
     Guided by the motto <em>“Education for Development”</em>, the school began with only two classroom blocks, 
     limited facilities, and five dedicated teachers led by the first headmaster, Mr. Ndesa. 
     Despite these humble beginnings, Maki welcomed 150 pioneer students and set out to provide quality 
     ordinary level education to the community.</p>
